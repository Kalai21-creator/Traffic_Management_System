### **README - Traffic Management System (C++)**  

# ðŸš¦ Traffic Management System  

## **Description**  
The **Traffic Management System** is a C++ application designed to monitor and regulate traffic flow efficiently. It simulates real-time traffic control using **vehicle detection, signal management, and congestion analysis**, ensuring smooth and safe transportation. The system optimizes traffic signals based on real-time conditions and manages priority vehicles like ambulances and fire trucks.  

## **Features**  
âœ… **Dynamic Traffic Signal Control** â€“ Adjusts signal timings based on traffic density.  
âœ… **Vehicle Detection & Counting** â€“ Uses sensor input (simulated) to detect vehicles.  
âœ… **Emergency Vehicle Priority** â€“ Automatically adjusts signals for ambulances/fire trucks.  
âœ… **Congestion Analysis** â€“ Identifies and manages high-traffic areas.  
âœ… **User-Friendly Interface** â€“ CLI-based system with clear outputs.  

## **Technology Used**  
ðŸ”¹ **Programming Language:** C++  
ðŸ”¹ **Concepts Used:** OOP (Classes & Objects), File Handling, Data Structures (Queues, Graphs), Multi-threading (optional)  
ðŸ”¹ **Algorithms:** Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (for shortest route), Traffic Flow Optimization  

## **Installation & Usage**  
### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic_management_system.git
cd traffic_management_system
```
### **2. Compile the Code**  
```bash
g++ traffic_management.cpp -o traffic_system
```
### **3. Run the Program**  
```bash
./traffic_system
```

## **Future Enhancements**  
ðŸš€ **Integration with IoT sensors** for real-world traffic data.  
ðŸš€ **GUI version** using Qt or GTK for better visualization.  
ðŸš€ **AI-based predictive traffic flow management.**
